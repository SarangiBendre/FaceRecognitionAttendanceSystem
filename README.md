## 🔐 Privacy & Security
- Student face images are stored locally only
- Face image datasets are excluded from GitHub using `.gitignore`
- No biometric data is uploaded to any cloud platform
- Designed with privacy-first principles

---

## 🔄 System Workflow
1. Register a student and capture face images
2. Train the face recognition model
3. Student marks attendance using face recognition
4. Attendance is recorded with date and time
